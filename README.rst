NOTE!
============

The core components of the ``arraymap`` package (``AutoMap``, ``FrozenAutoMap``) have been integrated into ``arraykit``:

https://github.com/static-frame/arraykit

As future development will happen there, this repository is now archived.


arraymap
============

The ArrayMap library provides dictionary-like lookup from NumPy array values to their integer positions. The hash table design and C implementation is based on [AutoMap](https://github.com/brandtbucher/automap), with extensive additions for direct support of NumPy arrays.


Code: https://github.com/static-frame/arraymap

Packages: https://pypi.org/project/arraymap



Dependencies
--------------

ArrayMap requires the following:

- Python >= 3.9
- NumPy >= 1.19.5
